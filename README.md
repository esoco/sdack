# The SDACK project

The **Simple Development Application Component Kit** (aka SDACK) project is a collection of framework (or better: a **stack** of frameworks) that provide a foundation to easily build web applications. These applications are typically created by defining processes that encapsulate the business logic of the application, and entities that describe the persistent state. All parts of the stack make use of the **ObjectRelations** framework, a new programming paradigm that allows the generic modeling of relations between object similar as object orientation defines the modeling of objects with classes.
