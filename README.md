# The SDACK project

The **Simple Development Application Component Kit** (aka SDACK) project is a collection (or stack) of frameworks. These provide a foundation to build process-oriented applications. To create a SDACK application you define processes and entities. Processes encapsulate the business logic and entities the persistent state of the application. The foundation of SDACK is the **ObjectRelations** framework. It allows the generic modeling of relations between objects, like object orientation defines the modeling of objects.
