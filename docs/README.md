# The SDACK project

The SDACK project is a stack (hence the naming) of frameworks which are included as sub-projects. These framework provide a base to build process-oriented applications with interactive user interfaces, mainly in web applications. Each framework has it's own specific purpose, like persistence, business process modeling, or user interfaces. One important foundation of SDACK is the [ObjectRelations](https://github.com/esoco/objectrelations) framework. It allows the generic modeling of relations between objects, similar to the modeling of objects in object orientation.

The project documentation can be found in the [SDACK documentation project](https://github.com/esoco/sdack-docs). The documentation is also [available on Gitbooks](https://esoco.gitbook.io/sdack/).
